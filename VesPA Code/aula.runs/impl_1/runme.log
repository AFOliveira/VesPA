WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net cpu/ctrl_unit/state_reg[1]_6 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/ctrl_unit/Z_reg_i_2/O, cell cpu/ctrl_unit/Z_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net cpu/ctrl_unit/state_reg[1]_7 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/ctrl_unit/N_reg_i_1/O, cell cpu/ctrl_unit/N_reg_i_1.
